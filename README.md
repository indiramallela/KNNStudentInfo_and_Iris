## Introduction

This document presents a code implementation for classifying the Iris dataset using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The goal is to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Similarly for StudentInfo, predicting the final result as either "withdrawn" or "not-withdrawn".

## Code Explanation

The code follows a step-by-step approach to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the k-NN models, make predictions, and evaluate the performance of the models.

### Load Required Packages


### Load and Preprocess the Data


### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets


### Train the k-NN Model


### Make Predictions on the Test Data


### Evaluate the Model


## Conclusion

In this analysis, we utilized the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify the Iris dataset into different species based on the flower's sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The k-NN model showed promising results in accurately predicting the species of Iris flowers.

Further analysis can be performed to fine-tune the model by adjusting the number of neighbors (`k`) and exploring other parameters. Additionally, visualizations can be created to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable.
